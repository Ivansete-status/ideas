# Waku - Idea Board


- Polling/Voting: Enable polling or voting off-chain, vote results could be aggregated and submitted on chain in one transaction.
- Marketplace (buy/sell goods or NFTs, ride-share, etc): Send offer and negotiate off-chain. Highest bids sent over Waku could be binding and submitted to the contract by seller.
- Collaborative editing: Use Waku for live collaborative editing of documents, saved version of documents can then be stored on decentralized storage.
- Multiplayer games: Waku can be used to communicate game move off-chain, final state (e.g. winner) can then be submitted on chain for reward (e.g. NFT mint or winner takes stake).
- IoT systems: Enable devices to communicate or report small data payload in a decentralized manner.
- Decentralized wallet address ownership verification: Use Waku to enable communication between dApp and wallet such as signature or zeroknowledge proof exchange to prove identity.
- Notifications centre: use an SDK (probably go-waku?) to build general Notification protocol over Waku and a mobile app allowing you to replace centralized Push Notifications provided by Apple/Google
- API generator: build a tool to generate a Waku protocol (and code) from a provided OpenAPI specification 
- Leader Election Protocol: Leader election can viewed as a soft consensus mechanism. Implement something like [RAFT](https://raft.github.io/) as a library on top of Waku (using any SDK), so that users can easily plug it in their applications
